    "text": "Factor Analysis helps us to examine a huge dataset and reduce the observable variables to fewer unobserved ones. This aids in understanding the correlations between factors and determining how the market is performing. Factors improve our ability to understand data. However, due to the interpretations, the results are relatively difficult to determine. Because there can be several meanings in one factor, factor analysis interpretations can be disputed and made up.\nIn order to calculate the changing values there is a need for a two dimensional representation of the values. The two dimension are based on the Traditional values versus Secular-rational values and Survival values versus *Self-expression values.\nRunning factor analysis on a set of ten indicators produces the two dimensions. The ten indicators utilized—five for each dimension—were selected for technical reasons: we wanted to be able to compare results over time, therefore we used indicators from each of the Values Surveys’ four waves. These ten indicators don’t necessarily represent the most sensitive indicators of these dimensions; rather, they simply represent a small portion of the various beliefs and values that these two dimensions tap. They do a decent job of capturing two crucial aspects of cross-cultural variation, but we should keep in mind that these particular items are really proxies for much larger underlying cross-cultural variance dimensions.11 Source: Chapter 2 from Inglehart, R & C. Welzel. 2005. Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence. New York: Cambridge University Press\n\n\n\nThe project has the following hypothesis:\n\n\\(H_0\\) = Change in Values has no social, political and economic effect\n\\(H_1\\) = Change in Values has a social, political and economic effect\n\nIn order to test these hypothesis the project looks at a subgroup of countries that have been subject to social, political and economic change.\nOne unsupervised machine learning approach used for dimensionality reduction is factor analysis. In order to express the common variance, or variation resulting from correlation among the observed variables, this approach constructs factors from the observed variables. It does sound a little technical, so let’s simplify it by dividing it into pizza and slices.\n\n\n\nFactor analysis involves a number of steps, including:\n\nBartlett’s Test of Sphericity and KMO Test\nDetermining the number of factors\nInterpreting the factors\n\nIn order to carry out the Factor analysis this project leveraes the following python libraries:\n\nfactor_analyzer2\nnumpy3\npandas4\nmatplotlib5\n\n2 https://factor-analyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/factor_analyzer.html3 https://numpy.org/doc/4 https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/5 https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html\n\n\nThe Bartlett’s test6 determines whether a correlation exists in the provided data. It investigates if the correlation matrix is an identical matrix, which is the null hypothesis (H0). The same matrix has all the same diagonal entries as number 1. The null hypothesis therefore presupposes that there is no association between the variables.6 https://factor-analyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/factor_analyzer.html?highlight=calculate_bartlett_sphericity#factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer.calculate_bartlett_sphericity\nBecause factor analysis tries to explain the common variance, or the variation caused by correlation among the variables, we want to reject this null hypothesis. A correlation between the variables is present with a 95% confidence level if the p test statistic value is less than 0.05, indicating that the correlation is not an identical matrix.\n\n\nCode\nfrom factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer import calculate_bartlett_sphericity\n\nchi_square_value, p_value = calculate_bartlett_sphericity(X)\nchi_square_value, p_value\n\n\n(805561.4129035972, 0.0)\n\n\nSince the p test statistic is less than 0.05, we can infer that there is correlation between the variables, which is a clear indication that factor analysis should be used.\n\n\n\nThe KMO Test calculates the percentage of variance that could be shared by all the variables. Greater proportions are anticipated since they show greater connection between the variables, allowing for the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like factor analysis. KMO score ranges from 0 to 1, and values greater than 0.6 are highly valued. It also serves as a gauge of how well our data lends itself to factor analysis.\n\n\nCode\nfrom factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer import calculate_kmo\n\nkmo_all,kmo_model=calculate_kmo(X)\nkmo_model\n\n\n0.8603319592485171\n\n\nThe overall proportion of variation for the data is greater than 0.80. It demonstrates that there is more correlation in our data and that dimensionality reduction strategies like factor analysis can be used.\n\n\n\nEigenvalue is important in determining the number of elements required. Normally, an eigenvalue of 1 or above is used to establish if a factor is beneficial. This may be shown in a scree plot to determine how many factors will be used.\n\n\n\nOur dataset has the same amount of variables and components as other datasets. There won’t be much meaningful information regarding the common variance among the variables provided by all the factors. Therefore, we must choose the number of components. The amount of common variance each factor explains can be used to determine the number of factors. In general, we will plot the eigenvalues and the factors.\nSince there are two dimensions each with 2 poles, the number of factors required are 2.\n\n\nCode\n# Create factor analysis object and perform factor analysis for 2 factors\nfrom factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer import FactorAnalyzer\nfa = FactorAnalyzer(n_factors=2, rotation='varimax')\n\n# Possible rotations:\n# - varimax (orthogonal rotation)\n# - promax (oblique rotation)\n# - oblimin (oblique rotation)\n# - oblimax (orthogonal rotation)\n# - quartimin (oblique rotation)\n# - quartimax (orthogonal rotation)\n# - equamax (orthogonal rotation)\n\nfa.fit(X)\nfa.get_factor_variance()\n\neigen_values, vectors = fa.get_eigenvalues()\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Create scree plot using matplotlib\nplt.scatter(range(1,X.shape[1]+1),eigen_values)\nplt.plot(range(1,X.shape[1]+1),eigen_values)\nplt.title('Scree Plot')\nplt.xlabel('Factors')\nplt.ylabel('Eigenvalue')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here we transform the entire dataset based on these factors and get a dataset that can be used for visualization.\n\n\nCode\ndf_features = X\nfa.fit(X)\nX_transformed = fa.transform(df_features)\nX_clean = pd.DataFrame(X_transformed)\nfactor_df=pd.DataFrame(fa.loadings_,index=X.columns)\n\n\nThe output has the 2 factors ready to be plotted in the final visualization."

Through exploring the datasets for the previous years, this website aims to discover trends in the data and a visual implentation of the findigs.\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to visualize the chaging values of countries across a period of time. Through the changes, a selection of coutries are explored in order to measure if a change in the poles of the dimensions can be correlated to the change in social, political and economic development.\n\n\n\nThe project has the following hypothesis:\n\n\\(H_0\\) = Change in Values has no social, political and economic effect\n\\(H_1\\) = Change in Values has a social, political and economic effect\n\n\n\n\nThe World Values Survey (WVS) is an international research program devoted to the scientific and academic study of social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the world. The project’s goal is to assess which impact values stability or change over time has on the social, political and economic development of countries and societies. The project grew out of the European Values Study and was started in 1981 by its Founder and first President (1981-2013) Professor Ronald Inglehart from the University of Michigan (USA) and his team, and since then has been operating in more than 120 world societies.\n\nThe main research instrument of the project is a representative comparative social survey which is conducted globally every 5 years. Extensive geographical and thematic scope, free availability of survey data and project findings for broad public turned the WVS into one of the most authoritative and widely-used cross-national surveys in the social sciences. At the moment, WVS is the largest non-commercial cross-national empirical time-series investigation of human beliefs and values ever executed.\n\nThe WVS combines two institutional components. From one side, WVS is a scientific program and social research infrastructure that explores people’s values and beliefs. At the same time, WVS comprises an international network of social scientists and researchers from 120 world countries and societies. All national teams and individual researchers involved into the implementation of the WVS constitute the community of Principal Investigators (PIs). All PIs are members of the WVS."

    "text": "The two dimensional approach\nRonald Inglehart and Christian Welzel, two political scientists, claim that there are two main aspects of cross-cultural variation in the world:\n\nTraditional values versus Secular-rational values and\nSurvival values versus Self-expression values.\n\nTraditional values: The importance of religion, parent-child relationships, reverence to authority, and traditional family values are stressed by traditional values. These ideals are shared by those who disapprove of suicide, euthanasia, divorce, and abortion. These societies exhibit strong nationalistic tendencies and high levels of national pride.\nSecular-rational values: Traditional values are preferred less than secular-rational ideals. These societies place less value on authority, religion, and traditional family values. Suicide, euthanasia, divorce, and abortion are viewed as somewhat acceptable. (Suicide may not actually be more frequent.)\nSurvival values: Survival values prioritize physical and financial safety. It is associated with a generally ethnocentric viewpoint, low levels of tolerance, and trust.\nSelf-expression values: Values associated with self-expression place a high emphasis on the preservation of the environment, rising aspirations for political and economic engagement, increasing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians, and gender equality."

    "text": "The two dimensions were constructed by factor analysis on a set of ten indicators. The 10 indicators utilized (five for each dimension) were chosen for technical reasons: in order to compare findings over time, we used indicators from all four waves of the Values Surveys. These 10 indications represent only a small subset of the numerous beliefs and values that these two dimensions elicit, and they are not necessarily the most sensitive indicators of these dimensions. They do an excellent job of accessing two really significant aspects of cross-cultural variance, but it is vital to remember that these specific items are simply indications of much wider underlying dimensions of cross-cultural variation.\n\n\nThe traditional vs secular-rational values dimension highlights the difference between civilizations where religion is highly significant and those where it is not, yet obedience to God’s authority, fatherland, and family are all inextricably intertwined. In traditional societies, a major goal in most people’s lives is to make their parents proud; and one must always love and respect one’s parents regardless of how they behave; conversely, parents must do their best for their children, even if it means sacrificing their own well-being; and people idealize large families (and actually have them: high scores on this dimension correlate strongly with high fertility rates).\nTraditional societies accept national authority passively: they rarely discuss politics, despite having high levels of national pride, favoring more respect for authority, taking protectionist attitudes toward foreign trade, and believing that environmental problems can be solved without international agreements. The family is critical to survival in preindustrial society. As a result, communities at the traditional pole of this dimension oppose divorce and advocate against abortion, euthanasia, and suicide. They value social conformity above personal striving, value obedience to authority, and have a strong sense of national pride and a patriotic viewpoint. On all of these problems, societies with secular-rational ideals have opposing choices.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('factor_secular.csv')\n\n# PLOT\ndf = df.sort_values(by = 'secular')\nfig = px.bar(df,y=df.iloc[:,0],x=\"secular\", orientation='h')\nfig.add_hrect(\n        y0=2.5, y1=5, line_width=0, \n        fillcolor=\"green\", opacity=0.1,\n        annotation_text=\"Secular\", annotation_position=\"top\",\n        )\nfig.add_hrect(\n        y0=2.5, y1=-1, line_width=0, \n        fillcolor=\"red\", opacity=0.1,\n        annotation_text=\"Traditional\", annotation_position=\"bottom\",\n        )\nfig.update_xaxes(visible=False)\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\nThe survival vs self-expression dimension taps into a postindustrial syndrome of tolerance, trust, emphasis on subjective well-being, civic involvement, and self-expression that occurs in societies with high levels of existential security and individual liberty. People in societies shaped by existential insecurity and rigid intellectual and social constraints on human autonomy, on the other hand, prioritize economic and physical security over all else; they are threatened by foreigners, ethnic diversity, and cultural change, which leads to intolerance of gays and other outgroups, insistence on traditional gender roles, and an authoritarian political outlook. The polarization of materialist and postmaterialist ideals is a key component of this level.\nThese values reflect an intergenerational movement away from economic and physical security and toward a greater emphasis on self-expression, subjective well-being, and life quality. This cultural change may be recognized across postindustrial civilization; it arises among birth cohorts who have grown up in settings where survival is taken for granted. These ideals are connected to the growing emphasis on environmental conservation, the women’s movement, and increased demands for involvement in economic and political decision-making. These principles have been more prevalent in practically all postindustrial civilizations during the last thirty years. Societies that prioritize survival principles have low levels of subjective well-being, poor health, and low levels of interpersonal trust, intolerance of outgroups, and support for gender equality. They place an emphasis on materialist values, have a high level of confidence in science and technology, are low on environmental action, and prefer authoritarian rule. Societies that place a high priority on self-expression tend to have opposing preferences on all of these areas. Self-expression principles, in general, represent an emancipatory and humanistic ethos that emphasizes individual autonomy and choice. When survival is uncertain, cultural variety appears to be a threat. When there isn’t enough food to go around, foreigners are viewed as dangerous outsiders who may grab one’s food.\nIn an attempt to enhance predictability in an unpredictable environment, people adhere to established gender roles and sexual norms, stressing absolute laws and old familiar standards. When survival becomes a given, ethnic and cultural variety become more tolerable - fact, beyond a certain point, diversity is not only accepted but positively prized since it is intriguing and engaging. People in postindustrial countries seek out international restaurants to try different cuisines; they spend high prices and travel considerable distances to experience exotic cultures. Changing gender roles and sexual norms no longer appear to be a concern. The transition toward gender equality, which allows women to pick from a considerably larger range of life paths than ever before, has been one of the most profound cultural upheavals since the start of recorded history.\nPolarization over new gender roles is a crucial component of the survival vs self-expression dimension; one of its most contentious problems is whether men or women make better political leaders. A majority of the globe still believes that males make better political leaders than women; however, this view is being challenged by expanding majorities in postindustrial economies, as well as by the younger generation within these cultures. Equal rights for women, homosexuals and lesbians, immigrants, and other outgroups are often rejected in civilizations where existence is precarious, but are increasingly embraced in communities that value self-expression. Thus, each of modernization’s two key phases - industrialization and the creation of postindustrial society - gives birth to a significant component of cross-cultural diversity.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('factor_self_expression.csv')\n\n# PLOT\n\ndf = df.sort_values(by = 'self_expression')\nfig = px.bar(df.sort_values(by = 'self_expression'),y=df.iloc[:,0],x=\"self_expression\", orientation='h')\nfig.add_hrect(\n        y0=2.5, y1=5, line_width=0, \n        fillcolor=\"green\", opacity=0.1,\n        annotation_text=\"Self Expression\", annotation_position=\"top\",\n        )\nfig.add_hrect(\n        y0=2.5, y1=-1, line_width=0, \n        fillcolor=\"red\", opacity=0.1,\n        annotation_text=\"Survival\", annotation_position=\"bottom\",\n        )\nfig.update_xaxes(visible=False)\nfig.show()"
